==========

This is a "vanilla" extension of the Pillar server framework.

This works as a standalone application to illustrate how to expand Pillar for new extensions.

## How to setup the documentation

```bash
cd docs
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs build
```

The documentation will be available at `site/index.html`.
