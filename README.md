Dillo 2.0
==========

Dillo 2.0 is an extension of the [Pillar](https://pillarframework.org/) framework.

Main features in Dillo 2.0:
* Built-in search
* Multi-language support
* Fast. (not that 1.0 was slow, but this is like, crazy fast)

Besides all the bells and whistles, the new Dillo is an extension of the Pillar framework. 
Pillar is developed and maintained by the Blender Animation Studio, powering services such 
as [Blender Cloud](https://cloud.blender.org/), [Attract](https://cloud.blender.org/attract), 
and [Flamenco](https://www.flamenco.io/). Meaning that all the core features (comments, 
authentication, and so on) will have support and fixes much faster than when Dillo was a 
stand-alone application, leaving time to develop more Dillo specific features!
